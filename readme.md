# Project for Mobile Computing WS23/24 @ KIT

## Web Puzzle Game
### Features
- Supports both Image and Video input and displays it dynamically via canvas puzzle-tiles
- Supports Video input from Camera via WebRTC
- Tiles dynamically resize with the browser
- Dark mode switch
- Auto detect prefered user-theme and select it on start
- Use custom median color for image borders or change to the classic
- Use custom color for borders

### Planned Features
- Maybe a different view mode (unlikely, tried it but the normal view, which is being used, felt best)
- Currently none! :)

### Impossible to implement
- Safari mobile support for video tiles (can't see the safari logs due to lack of macbook)
- Didn't test mobile support on Android devices
